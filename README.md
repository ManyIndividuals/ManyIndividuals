# ManyIndividuals

We are a network of researchers with field sites investigating hypotheses that involve generalizing across many individuals (e.g., populations or species). We conduct the same tests in the same way across species to determine whether the results of particular experiments are generalizable beyond that population or species. 

## Research questions
 - Can behavioral flexibility in species associated with human modified environments (California scrub jays and great-tailed grackles) be increased?
 - If so, does such an increase help threatened species (toutouwai) survive in a city? 
 - Does survival information spread faster through social learning?

## Founders
 - [Dr. Kelsey McCune](https://www.kelseymccune.com) - designed the foraging predictability experiment and conducts experiments in California scrub jays at her field site in northern California
 - [Dr. Rachael Shaw](https://thinkingbehaviour.org) -  conducts experiments in the threatened toutouwai at her field site in New Zealand, then assesses the manipulation’s impact on their ability to survive in a human modified environment
 - [Dr. Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com) - designed the serial reversal manipulation and conducts experiments in great-tailed grackles at her field site in northern California


## The experiments

 - **Manipulating behavioral flexibility through serial reversal learning:** [protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hKGUNO1SpnXAT8DN_GXb56Aw6WzCraCIUKiP9gVI6o/edit?usp=sharing), [pseudorandomized option on left order](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B3-ZKd4nr_4gA91Pu2eUUBOriwW-V88VRgK9c1lDSjY/edit?usp=sharing), [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QakS8TMe4WRv_QWKrHaWHyJSXbQwl8v9Y061SY914Wg/edit?usp=sharing) for interobserver reliability video coders who code 20% of the videos from the experiment
 - **Manipulating behavioral flexibility through what where when memory using foraging predictability:**
     - **GPS tracking:** [protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOpkdxy5-wiGg7hYod-XaaBoOl53DsVQ3pwWoIdvrzk/edit?usp=sharing) with radio tag attachment instructions and how to GPS track tagged and non-tagged individuals

## The tools: an open and verifiable workflow that makes research better and faster

We use several tools that allow us to make our research open and verifiable, which also makes our research better and faster. This is the infrastructure we use, which is replicable so feel free to try it out!

#### Materials shared within the network

 - [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-de/) group (private) for coordinated conversations that don’t clog up inboxes (can use Mattermost [open source] instead of Slack, but you have to host the conversations on your own server)
 - [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) for all data sheets so everyone can enter/edit/see everything at the same time. What to code in each column is clearly defined in the Protocol…
 - [Keeper](https://keeper.mpdl.mpg.de) is an online data back up space with ready-made folders for each experiment. Experimenters upload data sheets and videos daily. File naming instructions are included in each protocol here at GitHub (IndividualID_YYYY-MM-DD_ExpName_SessionNumber_TrialNumber)

#### Materials shared within each lab

 - [Signal](https://signal.org) for when experimenters need immediate access to coordinators while testing
 - [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) for each lab to coordinate the project internally
 - [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) album for each lab so experimenters can add photos and everyone can access them for their presentations/articles/websites
 
#### Public materials
 - GitHub repository (this page that you are reading) for registered reports, final data sheets, bibliography, etc. Make one folder called “Files” and put everything in there (except for the readme file) using…
 - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) to push and pull files between your computer and your GitHub repo using folders (you can make folders on your computer, but not at GitHub directly)
 - [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) (rmd) is a reproducible manuscript where we write registered reports/articles. Rmd files contain all of the analysis code and text in one document. Put data sheets at the public GitHub repository and call them in the R code inside the rmd file and then anyone anywhere can download your rmd file and run your analyses in the same way you did. Open rmd files in [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) (e.g., https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/Files/Preregistrations/gxpopbehaviorhabitat.Rmd)
 - [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) to write experimental protocols and link to them in the registered reports and articles at GitHub (e.g., http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gxpopbehaviorhabitat.html#Protocols_and_open_materials)
    - Make the shareable link VIEW ONLY so the public can’t edit it; share directly with collaborators and experimenters and list them as editors so they can update as testing progresses
    - Write exceptions at the protocols as you go for anything that comes up that was not planned or had to be tweaked

## Code of conduct

#### We conduct open, verifiable, ethical research

 - All research that generates experimental data starts off as a registered report
 - If research outputs are disseminated via a journal (rather than only at [Peer Community In](https://peercommunityin.org)), the journal must have the following features (why? See Logan [2017](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2) and Corina's [website](http://corinalogan.com/journals.html)): 
    - Be 100% open access
    - Select articles based on scientific validity, not subjective impact
    - Be published by an ethical publisher (e.g., non-profit, researcher run) 
    - Is not part of a contract where institutes pay to publish open access (e.g., read and publish agreements, transformative agreements - read why these are unethical [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUuoHV8yA0TSLUCo0PhrzfR5lwWruZQibKimOoVVJ6E/edit?usp=sharing)) (note: institutes pre-paying APCs in batches at a journal is ok as long as there is no contract)
    - The review history must be publicly available
    - The article must be published under a CC BY license
    - It should be free to publish (no APCs) or very cheap

#### We strive to take anti-racist and anti-sexist action

 - Selection of new team members is designed to counteract racist/sexist biases (details [here](https://osf.io/afwre/wiki/home/))
 - We recognize that some lab members require additional supports to safely conduct their work. We strive to work together to develop and implement these supports
 - We implement learnings from anti-racist and anti-sexist resources such as those from [Dr. Romero-Olivares lab](https://www.fungiloverlab.com/dei). 

#### We cultivate a harassment-free and welcoming environment

 All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody. 

***The Quick Version***
The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. (However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of, for example, animal reproduction are appropriate.) We value individual differences and strive to create a welcoming environment for lab members. 

***The Less Quick Version***
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Corina Logan (corina_logan [at] eva.mpg.de) immediately. If Corina is the cause of your concern, contact another member of the network.

We realize that people come from all over the world to work on research projects with our network, and we strive to make everyone feel welcome. For example, English may not be the native language of many lab members; therefore, we will take the time to go slowly and prioritize understanding over speed or convenience. As well, many lab members are multi-lingual, which can help facilitate communication. 

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.
