Do flexibility manipulated individuals differ in their visits to outdoor cafes and garbage dumpsters on regular days (when there is more food availability) than on holidays when they are closed (thus reduced food availability)?,"Prediction 1.1: If individuals rely more on flexibility, they will likely decrease the frequency and duration of their visits on holidays because other environmental cues could indicate the lack of food availability (e.g., reduced human presence, no visible food, no garbge trucks or garbage spilled on the ground). This is because flexibility is the functional tracking of resources across time and space: one knows a variety of places to obtain food and prefers to forage at those with higher pay offs. If no food is available at a usual food location, then the more functional choice is to go somewhere else that does have food.",,Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) will be used for,-,See the predictions in the Hypothesis column,NA
,"Prediction 1.2: If individuals rely more on what-where-when memory (WWW, remembering what food was where and when from a previous experience they had) [@clayton_episodic-like_1998; @clayton_prometheus_2003], they will likely increase the frequency and duration of their visits on holidays because the closure is a violation of their expectations. These expectations are based on associations between food and this place and time that have been built from multiple past experiences. Therefore, they would likely keep checking this location, which is expected to have more food availability at this time.",,"Cafes:

,"Prediction 1.3: If there is no difference in the frequency and/or duration of visits between regular days and holidays, this could indicate that the flexibility manipulation did not manipulate an ability that is linked to foraging visits to cafes and dumpsters.",,Model 2: Duration of visits ~ Time (before/after) + (ID),-,,
,"Prediction 1.4: If the holiday frequency of visits increases while the duration decreases, this could indicate that WWW memory is being used because individuals keep checking the location they expect food to be, but that these visits are short and used for checking for food cues (including looking for human presence), which is likely faster than stopping to eat food that is present.",,Dumpsters:,-,,

,"Prediction 2: There will be no difference between pre- and post- experiment frequency and duration of visits at dumpsters because garbage pick up is generally once per week, which might be too long of a period to be able to accurately remember (i.e., can individuals count to 7 days?). However, we do predict a difference between pre- and post- experiment frequency and duration of visits (as outlined in Predictions 1.1-1.5) at cafes because they are generally open daily and therefore do not require longer-term memory retention to track.",,Model 4: Duration of visits ~ Time (before/after) + (ID),-,,
Does information about which feeder contains the food spread faster through social learning?,Prediction 3.1 Individuals (observers who had never solved) who learn about resources by watching those individuals (demonstrators who had already solved) are faster to use such resources than observers who were not exposed to demonstrators.,,"Using a multilevel experience-weighted attraction model, we will examine whether observers are more likely to learn from demonstrators of a particular sex or age (<1 year or >1 year), whether the rate of updating differs by sex or age, and whether the feeder's pay-off (accessible or inaccessible) played a role in the choice of feeder",-,See the predictions in the Hypothesis column,NA
