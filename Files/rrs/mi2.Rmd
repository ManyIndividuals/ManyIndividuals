# **INTRODUCTION**

Human modified environments are increasing (Goldewijk, 2001; X. Liu et al., 2020; Wu et
al., 2011), causing global changes that other species must adjust to or suffer from
(Alberti, 2015; Chejanovski et al., 2017; Ciani, 1986; Federspiel et al., 2017). Behavioral
flexibility (hereafter ‘flexibility’) could be key to adjusting to such change: individuals interact
with their environment through behavior, therefore whether a species has the flexibility to
change behavior when circumstances change could be crucial for adjusting to environmental
changes (Lee & Thornton, 2021). One of the top priorities for behavioral research with regard to
maximizing conservation progress is to determine which cognitive abilities and behaviors can
predict the ability to adjust to human modified environments and whether these behaviors can
be trained (Moseby et al., 2016). The rare research that trains behavior in a conservation
context usually focuses on training specific behaviors (for example, predator recognition through
predator exposure) to improve individual success in the wild (Jolly et al., 2018; Moseby et al.,
2012; Ross et al., 2019; West et al., 2018; see review in Tetzlaff et al., 2019). However, training
a general cognitive ability, such as flexibility – the ability to rapidly adapt behavior to
changes through learning throughout the lifetime (see the theory behind this definition in
Mikhalevich et al., 2017) – has the potential to change a whole suite of behaviors and more
broadly influence success in adjusting to human modified environments. Recent evidence
supports this hypothesis: as far as I am aware, I was the first to show that flexibility can be
trained using serial reversal learning of color preferences, and that the trained individuals
(great-tailed grackles, Quiscalus mexicanus) were more flexible in a new context (locus
switching on a puzzlebox), more innovative (solved more loci on a puzzlebox) (Logan et al.,
2022), and used more food types and foraging techniques in the wild afterward (Logan et
al. 2025).

This investigation asks whether flexibility training (via serial reversal learning) can help
species succeed in human modified environments. I explore how far reaching the effects of
flexibility training extend in a species that is highly successful in human modified environments,
the great-tailed grackle (hereafter “grackles”), with the idea that these insights could be applied
to address critical conservation challenges. Serial reversal learning tasks have been performed
with a wide diversity of species (birds: Bond et al., 2007; bumblebees: Strang & Sherry, 2014;
stingrays: Daniel & Schluessel, 2020). There is variation across individuals and species in their
performance, however almost all previous studies show that individuals improve their flexibility if
the reversal training is given multiple times in sequence (serially; rats: Mackintosh et al., 1968;
guppies: Lucon-Xiccato & Bisazza, 2014; poison frogs: Y. Liu et al., 2016).

I aim to determine in grackles, a flexible species, whether it is indeed flexibility that
makes species successful in human modified environments, whether flexibility is
trainable in the wild, and discover for how long the effects of the training last. Grackles
are flexible (Logan, 2016; Logan et al., 2023), highly associated with human modified
environments (Johnson & Peer, 2001), and have been rapidly expanding their geographic range
across North America over the past 140 years (Wehtje, 2003). They are social and polygamous,
and eat a diversity of human foods as well as foraging on insects and on substrates for other
natural food items (Johnson & Peer, 2001). Males tend to be the socially dominant sex
(Johnson et al., 2000) and also the sex that disperses away from their natal area (Sevchik et al.,
2022). Rodrigo et al. (2021) found that more grackles are present and more foraging events
occur during garbage pick ups when garbage tends to spill out of the bags, thus increasing food
availability. Attending to garbage trucks, potentially across space and time, is an example of
how flexibility can help individuals meet foraging needs in the context of changing
environmental cues. Grackle behavioral flexibility is trainable using serial reversal learning, and
this training improves their flexibility in a new context as well as their innovativeness (Logan et
al., 2023), and, after release back to the wild, they eat a larger number of food types and use
more foraging techniques than untrained grackles (Logan et al., 2025) This shows that training
a general cognitive ability can affect more behaviors than the behavior that was trained and
potentially make them more successful in human modified environments.
The results from this research program will allow us to determine whether flexibility training
improves success in human modified environments. This research will significantly advance our
understanding of the causes and consequences of flexibility, linking

Determine for how long the effects, if any, from the flexibility training last. I
will investigate this by continuing to track the number of microhabitats and food items grackles
use for up to three years after the flexibility training has occurred. Effects in grackle flexibility
and innovativeness were still present for four weeks after the flexibility training (longer time
periods were not attempted so the threshold is unknown; Logan et al., 2023), and foraging
effects in the wild were still detected eight months after the flexibility training (longer time
periods were not attempted; Logan et al 2025). The longer the effects last, the more valuable
this flexibility training could be when applied to threatened and endangered species to try to
improve their success in human modified environments. In the event that the effects last only a
few months, there could still be significant advantages. Training the flexibility of a few individuals
could have population-level effects because significant research on social information use in
birds (e.g., Valente et al., 2021) demonstrates the potential for the trained behavior to
disseminate to conspecifics (for example, trained individuals might be faster at locating new
resources, which could attract the attention of conspecifics, or untrained individuals might copy
the trained individuals’ food type choices or foraging locations). In the event that social learning
is not used by a given population to spread the behaviors of trained individuals, investing in the
training of specific individuals to increase their success in the wild could still have conservation
impacts. In some cases, it is possible to train many individuals in a population or a species
because there are not many individuals left (Greggor et al., 2021). It is also possible to train all
individuals involved in a conservation management event such as a translocation (Greggor et
al., 2021). Therefore, there can still be significant population consequences even if each
individual needs to be trained to achieve the goal.

# **RESEARCH QUESTIONS**



# **METHODS**

My approach involves individuals participating in a serial reversal learning task and
measuring success in natural behavior in the wild using a within-subjects design where I
train all individuals and compare pre- and post-training success measures. Data collection
will occur across three field seasons, which are conducted in the non-breeding seasons
(August-January) of 2025, 2026, and 2027 to ensure the birds have more energy and attention
for participating in the research (Table 1). Field season data collection entails collecting foraging
data using focal follows before and after the flexibility training, which uses remote controlled
feeders for serial reversals of a color preference. In year 3, the final year, focal follow data will
be collected to obtain up to 3 years post-training foraging observations to determine for how
long any training effects last, and there will only be serial reversal training if the sample size is
not yet large enough. Additionally, in year 3, I will conduct a single reversal to determine how
long the flexibility training persisted for.

Focal follow (Altmann 1974) data (before and after flexibility training) will be collected on all
occurrences of microhabitats used, food types taken, foraging techniques used, location, and
whether food was present or absent from a given location. These data will be collected on a
minimum of 20 individuals with a minimum of 4 separate visit events to human food sources
(cafes or dumpsters) per individual pre-training or a maximum of 180 minutes of in view focal
time, and a minimum of 4 separate human food sources visit events or a maximum of 180
minutes of in view focal time, per individual post-training. The minimum focal time possible per
bird (pre- and post-training) is 60 minutes to ensure that there is enough microhabitat data.
Focal individuals will be followed for as long as possible during the hours when people generally
eat outside at cafes (approximately 11:00-14:00) until criterion is reached. Reaching criterion
may require conducting multiple focal follows on multiple days. Focal follows will be spaced
apart by at least one day.

For the flexibility training, I set up two feeders (one dark gray and one light gray) at a location
where grackles regularly visit in the wild (Figure 2). If a subject visits the feeder that has the
rewarded color, I cue the feeder to deliver a small amount of food. If a subject visits the feeder
that has the non-rewarded color, the choice will be recorded, but the feeder will not open. All
feeders contain one type of high value food (e.g., goldfish crackers). The dark gray feeder is
always the first rewarded color for a bird. A grackle is considered to have a color preference if it
chooses that color in 10 out of the most recent 12 trials, after which point, the other colored
feeder becomes the rewarded color. A bird is considered to have passed the serial reversal
training when it passes two consecutive reversals in 25 trials or less. Before starting the
training, grackles are exposed to a habituation feeder (green, blue, and white) where food is
available and presented to the target grackle until it is habituated to the feeder and the food refill
mechanism noise. To be ready to start the training, they need to hop up to the feeder when
there is no food visible in the tray, stay there when the feeder releases food (the refill noise),
then leave and come back to start another trial.

near side. Grackles are standing in front of each feeder where the food is dispensed into the
tray.
