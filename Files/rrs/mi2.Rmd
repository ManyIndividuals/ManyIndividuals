# **ANALYSIS PLAN**

We run analyses in R [current version `r getRversion()`; @rcoreteam] using the following R packages: rethinking [@rethinking2020], rstan [@rstan], cmdstanr [@cmdstanr], knitr [@xie2018knitr], and irr [@gamer2012package].

1) US Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory (federal bird banding permit number 23872 for grackles and 24273 for jays)
3) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California Santa Barbara (protocol number 958)
4) California Department of Fish and Wildlife (scientific collecting permit [specific use] number S‐192100001‐19210‐001 for grackles and S-192100002-20329-001 for jays)
