# ABSTRACT

Human modified environments are increasing, causing global changes that other species must adjust to or suffer from. Behavioral flexibility (hereafter 'flexibility') could be key: individuals interact with their environment through behavior, making it crucial to an ecologically valid understanding of how species adjust to environmental changes. One of the top priorities for behavioral research to maximize conservation progress is to determine which cognitive abilities and behaviors can predict the ability to adjust to human modified environments and whether these can be manipulated. The rare research that manipulates behavior in a conservation context trains specific behaviors (e.g., predator recognition through predator exposure) to improve individual success in the wild. However, training a general cognitive ability, such as behavioral flexibility (i.e., the ability to rapidly adapt behavior to changes through learning), has the potential to change a whole suite of behaviors and more broadly influence success in adjusting to human modified environments. This project asks whether flexibility can be increased by experimentally increasing environmental heterogeneity, whether such an increase can help species survive in human modified environments, and whether survival information spreads faster through social learning. We explore whether it is even possible to take insights from highly divergent species and apply them to address critical conservation challenges, which pushes the limits in terms of understanding how conserved these abilities may be and to what extent they can be shaped by the environment. We aim to 1) conduct flexibility interventions in two flexible species that are successful in human modified environments (great-tailed grackles and California scrub jays) to understand how flexibility relates to success and whether social learning increases the rate of behavioral change; and 2) implement the effective interventions in a threatened species (toutouwai) to determine whether flexibility as a generalizable cognitive ability can be trained and whether such training improves survival in human-modified environments. This research will significantly advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of flexibility, linking behavior to environmental change, cognition, and success in human modified environments through a comparative and global framework.

# INTRODUCTION

Human modified environments are increasing [e.g., @liu2020high; @wu2011quantifying; @goldewijk2001estimating], causing global changes that other species must adjust to or suffer from [e.g., @ciani1986intertroop; @chejanovski2017experimental; @federspiel2017adjusting; @alberti2015eco]. Behavioral flexibility (hereafter 'flexibility') could be key: individuals interact with their environment through behavior, making it crucial to an ecologically valid understanding of how species adjust to environmental changes [@lee2021animal]. One of the top priorities for behavioral research to maximize conservation progress is to determine which cognitive abilities and behaviors can predict the ability to adjust to human modified environments and whether these can be manipulated [@moseby2016harnessing]. The rare research that manipulates behavior in a conservation context usually focuses on training specific behaviors (e.g., predator recognition through predator exposure) to improve individual success in the wild [e.g., @moseby2012can; @west2018predator; @jolly2018out; @ross2019reversing; see review in @tetzlaff2019effects]. However, training a general cognitive ability, such as flexibility -- the ability to rapidly adapt behavior to changes through learning throughout the lifetime [see the theory behind this definition in @mikhalevich_is_2017] -- has the potential to change a whole suite of behaviors and more broadly influence success in adjusting to human modified environments. 

Environments where informational cues about resources vary in a heterogenous (but non-random) way across space and time are hypothesized to open a pathway for species to functionally detect and react to such cues via flexibility [@mikhalevich_is_2017]. Human modified environments likely provide a different set of informational cues that vary heterogeneously across space and time, and the species that are successful in such environments are likely those who are able to detect and track such cues. Because heterogeneous environments are hypothesized to select for flexibility, we expect that experimentally manipulating environments to be more hetereogenous will result in an increase in flexibility in individuals, which will then increase their success and survival in such environments. Success and survival can relate to any number of variables regarding the usage of and investment in resources, from improved foraging efficiency to increased dispersal into human modified environments to placing nests in more protective locations. Measures of success and survival depend on the particular populations in their particular environments. 

This investigation asks whether flexibility can be increased by experimentally increasing environmental heterogeneity, whether such an increase can help species survive in human modified environments, and whether survival information spreads faster through social learning. We explore whether it is even possible to take insights from highly divergent species and apply them to address critical conservation challenges, which pushes the limits in terms of understanding how conserved these abilities may be and to what extent they can be shaped by the environment. We aim to conduct flexibility interventions in two flexible species that are successful in human modified environments (great-tailed grackles and California scrub jays) to understand how flexibility relates to success and whether social learning increases the rate of behavioral change, and implement these interventions in a threatened species (toutouwai) to determine whether flexibility as a generalizable cognitive ability can be trained and whether such training improves survival in human modified environments (Figure 1). The results will substantially advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of flexibility, linking behavior to environmental change, cognition, and success in human modified environments through a comparative and global framework.

**Great-tailed grackles (*Quiscalus mexicanus*)** are flexible [@logan2016flexibilityproblem; @logan2019flexmanip], highly associated with human modified environments [@johnson2001great], and have been rapidly expanding their geographic range across North America over the past 140 years [@wehtje2003range]. They are social and polygamous, and eat a diversity of human foods as well as foraging on insects and on substrates for other natural food items [@johnson2001great]. They appear to follow garbage trucks on garbage day where they forage on the spillage from the garbage bags [@Rodrigo2021gtgr]. Attending to garbage trucks, potentially across space and time, is an example of how flexibility can help individuals meet foraging needs in the context of changing environmental cues.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

## Q1: Can behavioral flexibility in individuals be increased by increasing environmental heterogeneity? If so, does increased flexibility help individuals survive in human modified environments? 

**Prediction 1:** Flexibility can be increased in individuals and such an increase **improves the likelihood of survival in human modified environments**. This would indicate that the abilities involved in tracking changing resources in the environment are the same as or related to the abilities involved in surviving in human modified environments. It would also indicate that flexibility is trainable and that such training could be a useful conservation tool for threatened and endangered species. 

**Prediction 1 alternative 1:** Flexibility can be increased in individuals, but such an increase **does not improve the likelihood of survival** in human modified environments. This would indicate that species associated with human modified environments form this association for reasons other than their flexibility, and that threatened species are likely not very successful in human modified environments for reasons unrelated to their ability to change their behavior with changing circumstances.

**Prediction 1 alternative 2:** Flexibility can be increased in some populations, but not others. This would indicate that flexibility manipulations may not work for all populations, and that the effectiveness of such experiments should first be tested in the population of interest before including such an intervention in a conservation plan. If flexibility is not manipulatable in threatened populations, this would indicate that they are likely not very successful in human modified environments because of their inability to change their behavior with changing circumstances, and that flexibility is not trainable. If flexibility is not manipulatable in populations that are successful in human modified environments, this could indicate that they might have used flexibility in the past when originally forming the association, but the need to maintain flexibility in their repertoire is no longer necessary. In populations where flexibility is not manipulatable, this would indicate that the abilities involved in tracking changing resources in the environment and are independent of the abilities involved in surviving in human modified environments.


## Q2: Does survival information spread faster through social learning?

**Prediction 2:** Individuals (observers) who learn about resources by watching those individuals (demonstrators) who were in the flexibility manipulation, are **faster** to use such resources than observers who were not exposed to demonstrators.

**Prediction 2 alternative 1:** Individuals (observers) who learn about resources by watching those individuals (demonstrators) who were in the flexibility manipulation, are **slower** to use such resources than observers who were not exposed to demonstrators.

**Prediction 2 alternative 2:** Individuals (observers) who learn about resources by watching those individuals (demonstrators) who were in the flexibility manipulation, **do not differ** in their use of such resources compared with observers who were not exposed to demonstrators.


# METHODS

We present two designs for flexibility intervention experiments. Experimenters can decide which (or both) they want to conduct in their population. Only one experiment must be conducted per population to be able to test these hypotheses. Conducting more than one of these experiments per population is acceptable, but not necessary. 

## **Design 1 - Reversal learning experiment** 

Half of the individuals (manipulated group) undergo serial reversal learning until they meet the passing criterion, while the other half (control group) receive only one reversal (Figure 2). A reversal of where the reward is placed represents environmental heterogeneity, and those individuals who have enough experience in this heterogeneous environment through multiple reversals are able to learn to improve their flexibility (the number of trials it takes to change a preference). This flexibility intervention has been shown to work in great-tailed grackles where 8 out of 9 individuals in the serial reversal group passed the passing criterion (passing 2 consecutive reversals in 50 trials or less) within their given time frame [@logan2019flexmanip]. No social learning component is possible with this design because the experiment depends solely on individual learning in visual isolation of others.

**Figure 2.** Template design for the reversal learning experiment.

### Planned Sample

At least 20 individuals per population will be tested (50% in the control condition, 50% in the flexibility manipulation condition). Individuals will be randomly assigned to the control and flexibility manipulation conditions using a random number generator (random.org). The first rewarded option (i.e., color, shape, etc.) in reversal learning is counterbalanced across individuals at each site. The rewarded option is pseudorandomized for side (and the option on the left is always placed first). Pseudorandomization consists of alternating location for the first two trials of a session and then keeping the same color on the same side for at most two consecutive trials thereafter. A list of all 88 unique trial sequences for a 10-trial session, following the pseudorandomization rules, will be generated in advance for experimenters to use during testing (e.g., a randomized trial sequence might look like: LRLLRRLRLR, where L and R refer to the location, left or right, of the rewarded tube). Randomized trial sequences will be assigned randomly to any given 10-trial session using a random number generator (random.org) to generate a number from 1-88.

**Minimum sample size:** The minimum sample size of 20 was determined using Bayesian simulations in Logan et al. [2020](http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gxpopbehaviorhabitat.html#Q1:_behavior_across_the_range). 

**Data collection stopping rule:** Data collection will be stopped when the minimum sample size is reached or when the season in which the minimum sample size is reached comes to an end.

### Protocols

[Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hKGUNO1SpnXAT8DN_GXb56Aw6WzCraCIUKiP9gVI6o/edit?usp=sharing) for reversal learning of a color preference used by @logan2019flexmanip on great-tailed grackles. We also use a spreadsheet to [pseudorandomize](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B3-ZKd4nr_4gA91Pu2eUUBOriwW-V88VRgK9c1lDSjY/edit?usp=sharing) the order of presentation of the option on the left. We conduct interobserver reliability by having hypothesis-blind video coders code all of the videos for 20% of the individuals in the experiment: [instructions for video coders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QakS8TMe4WRv_QWKrHaWHyJSXbQwl8v9Y061SY914Wg/edit?usp=sharing).


## **Design 2 - Feeder experiment** 

Half of the individuals (manipulated group) are exposed to feeders that open at irregular times until they meet the passing criterion, while the other half (control group) are exposed to feeders that open regularly (Figure 3). The irregular opening times represents environmental heterogeneity, and those individuals who have enough experience in this heterogeneous environment through multiple exposures are able to learn to improve their flexibility (latency to approach the right feeder at the right time - i.e., when it is open). In both designs, both groups are habituated to the open feeders filled with food until at least 3 individuals have visited more than 50% of the feeders, the manipulated group passing criterion is tailored to each population based on prior knowledge on this or similar experiments, and data are collected on success/survival measures either before and after the flexibility intervention or only after the intervention (depending on feasibility and how the study design needs to be tailored for each population). **KELSEY do we want to say anything about all of the "piloting" we're doing in GTGR in space use?** The social learning component is conducted during this experiment.

**Figure 3.** Template design for the feeder experiment.

### Planned Sample

50% of the individuals or locations will be assigned to the control condition and 50% to the flexibility manipulation condition. Assignment to condition will be random (using random number generator random.org).

**Minimum sample size:** To determine the ability to detect actual effects in the analyses, we ran a power analysis in G&ast;Power with the following settings: test family=F tests, statistical test=linear multiple regression: Fixed model (R^2 deviation from zero), type of power analysis=a priori, alpha error probability=0.05. We set the power at 0.70. We found that, to have a 70% chance of detecting a medium effect (approximated at f^2=0.15 by @cohen1988statistical), the minimum sample size needs to be 44 for analyses with 1 explanatory variable.

**Data collection stopping rule:** Data collection will be stopped when the minimum sample size is reached or when the season in which the minimum sample size is reached comes to an end.

### Protocols

**Feeder habituation:** All feeders at all locations will have food and be open 9a-3p on 5 consecutive days or until at least the half of minimum sample size in each condition (control and manipulated) have visited more than 50% of the feeders.

**Flexibility manipulation condition passing criterion:** the latency in seconds (from the beginning of the period in which the feeders in that location are open) to go to an open feeder is 10% faster for that individual at that particular feeder for 50% of the feeders.

**Control condition stopping criterion:** the experiment will end when half of the individuals in the manipulated condition pass criterion.

**Food in the feeders:** All feeders always have food in them to eliminate the confound due to olfactory differences between the feeders that could be introduced if only the active feeders have food in them. If a feeder needs to be refilled, refill all feeders consecutively in the same time period and refill each for the same amount of time even if that feeder does not need much or any food (in these cases, pretend to fill the feeder as you normally would). This eliminates confounds from cues provided by a differential amount of attention experimenters give the feeders depending on which needs refilling.

**Population-specific experimental protocols:**

 - [Great-tailed grackle protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTrcy7ztgYVSAP7rGA6Y_lAmZ7hK_-mB01zwy0oKh7w/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Protocol for applying radio tags and conducting GPS tracks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZOpkdxy5-wiGg7hYod-XaaBoOl53DsVQ3pwWoIdvrzk/edit?usp=sharing) from @mccune2020spaceuse
  - [Scrub jay protocol]()
  - [Toutouwai protocol]()
 
  
  - Social learning data collection: are observers more likely to touch a feeder or attempt to solve it faster if they see another (demonstrator) touch the feeder compared with observers who don't see demonstrators? **CORINA KELSEY NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT** 


## Assessment of survival likelihood with regard to the flexibility manipulation

After the manipulation, compare control individuals with individuals in the flexibility manipulation using one or more of the following measures. If possible, also conduct within individual comparisons of the selected measures (e.g., predictability of space use) in the control and manipulation groups before and after the flexibility manipulation. Choose population-relevant survival variables that are predicted to be the most likely to be used in human modified environments.

 - Fitness variables: nest success, number of offspring who survived to independence or adulthood, longevity, etc.
 - Foraging variables: diet breadth, number of foraging techniques used, etc.
 - Space use variables: predictability of space use (e.g., step length and turning angles), ability to disperse from a non-human modified environment to a human modified environment (assess success/survival after disperal if possible), etc.

## Open data

The data will be published in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity's data repository.


# ANALYSIS PLAN

## Blinding during analysis

Hypothesis- and data-blind video coders are recruited to conduct interobserver reliability of 20% of the videos for the reversal learning experiment. Blinding is usually not involved in the final analyses because the experimenters collect the data (and therefore have seen some form of it) and run the analyses. **CORINA KELSEY RACHAEL NEED TO ADD BLINDING MEASURES**

## Interobserver reliability of reversal learning

To determine whether experimenters coded the dependent variables in a repeatable way, hypothesis-blind video coders will first be trained in video coding the dependent variables (reversal learning: whether the bird made the correct choice or not), requiring a Cohen's unweighted kappa of 0.90 or above to pass training. This threshold indicates that the two coders (the experimenter and the video coder) agree with each other to a high degree [kappa: @landis1977measurement, using the psych package in R @psych]. After passing training, the video coders will code 20% of the videos for each experiment and the unweighted kappa will be calculated to determine how objective and repeatable scoring was for each variable, while noting that the experimenter has the advantage over the video coder because watching the videos is not as clear as watching the bird participate in person. The unweighted kappa is used when analyzing a categorical variable where the distances between the numbers are meaningless (e.g., 0=incorrect choice, 1=correct choice, -1=did not participate).
